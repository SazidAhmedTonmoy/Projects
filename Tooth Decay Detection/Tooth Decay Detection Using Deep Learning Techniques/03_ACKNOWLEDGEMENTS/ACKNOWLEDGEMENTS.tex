\par First and foremost, I would want to thank Almighty Allah for providing me the strength to carry out my duties and finish the report.\\
As a component of the Bachelor of Science (BSc) curriculum, the research program is highly beneficial in bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical experience. Through the theoretical knowledge, this report has been created to have a practical and professional experience.\\
I also want to express my sincere appreciation to all the lecturers who helped me by giving me the technical know-how and spiritual support I needed to finish the project thoroughly.\\
I must express my gratitude to my respected faculty member Dr. Sifat Momen for his undivided attention and assistance in reaching this goal. In addition, I am eternally thankful to the ECE department at North South University for giving me with a course like CSE 498 that allowed me to work on this project in depth and bring it to life as I had imagined.\\
I appreciate the moral and practical support my family and friends have given me as I've carved out this endeavor.\\
