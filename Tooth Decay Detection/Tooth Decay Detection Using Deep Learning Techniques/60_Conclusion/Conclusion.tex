\chapter{CONCLUSION}

Early identification of tooth decay can save costs on dental treatments and even reverse the decay process. A deep learning strategy to detect tooth decay is presented in this paper. The dataset was trained in two different object detection algorithms to see which one performed better. YOLOv6 was more accurate but YOLOv5 was faster in this condition. YOLOv4 was good but YOLOv5 and YOLOv6 was better in every angle. The YOLOv6 model had the highest accuracy of 99.2\%, while the YOLOv4 model had the lowest accuracy of 98.6\%.\\ 
In comparison to the current, CNN-based dental caries classification models, This suggested technique can produce results that are more spectacular while using less computing power. The nicest thing about our suggested approach is how easy it may be applied to various kinds of illness categorization based on medical images. Such a method will change the area of visual illness diagnostics and be of enormous use to medical Experts. Additionally, this work could benefit from the use of ocular image segmentation.  Additionally, a system like this would revolutionize the field of diagnosing dental caries and be very helpful to medical professionals. my opinion is that it can still be a valuable model, and there will likely be possibilities to improve it with further research and study in the near future.
